• Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

• Working software over comprehensive documentation

• Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

• Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”

Agile emphasizes test-driven development (TDD) to reduce mistakes by writing the tests before writing the code, user stories to reach agreement and validate customer requirements, and velocity to measure project progress.

• Coveting conciseness, in using compact syntax and by raising the level of design by

using higher-level languages. Examples include reflection, which allows programs

to observe themselves at runtime, and higher-order functions, which allow higherlevel behaviors to be reused by passing functions as arguments to other functions.

• Synthesizing implementations.

• Reusing designs by following the principle of Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) and

by relying upon innovations that help reuse, such as procedures, libraries, objectoriented programming, and design patterns.

• Using (and inventing) tools to automate tedious tasks
