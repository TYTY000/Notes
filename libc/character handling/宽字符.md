The amount of memory allocated for a byte array may extend past the null byte that marks the end of the string that the array contains. In this document, the term _allocated size_ is always used to refer to the total amount of memory allocated for an array, while the term _length_ refers to the number of bytes up to (but not including) the terminating null byte. Wide strings are similar, except their sizes and lengths count wide characters, not bytes.


A notorious source of program bugs is trying to put more bytes into a string than fit in its allocated size. When writing code that extends strings or moves bytes into a pre-allocated array, you should be very careful to keep track of the length of the text and make explicit checks for overflowing the array. Many of the library functions _do not_ do this for you! Remember also that you need to allocate an extra byte to hold the null byte that marks the end of the string.
